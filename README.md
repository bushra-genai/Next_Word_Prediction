# ðŸ§  Next Word Prediction using GRU

This repository contains a **Next Word Prediction** project implemented using a custom **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** model in Python.  
The project demonstrates how GRUs can learn sequential dependencies in natural language and predict the next word from input text.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Custom GRU cell implementation (forward + backward pass)
- Training on toy sentences for demonstration
- Predicts the **next word** given an input sequence
- Visualizes **GRU hidden state activations**
- Written in pure Python + NumPy (no high-level deep learning libraries)
